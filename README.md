FiveM Interactions allows players to interact with the world of Los Santos, Blaine County and Cayo Perico by performing NPC animations/scenarios at set locations and on specific props.




This is not to be confused with my other repository, [Server Scenarios](https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/server_scenarios) , which adds and cleans up custom scenarios for FiveM, however you can use it to add more scenarios to your server, and fivem-interactions will work with it üòé

# FAQ's üìù

**Q: How can I add more Interactions to the world?**

**A:** You can use [Codewalker](https://discord.gg/CxaFxZ7yux) and [Server Scenarios](https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/server_scenarios) to add interactions to the location you wish

------------------------------------------

**Q: How can I add more interactive props? Is there a list of props that work?**

**A:** You can add the props to the world via ymap files using codewalker, or add them to MLO interiors using the ytyp files and generating a manifest in codewalker. 

As for a list of props, the short answer is no. Roam the world, find a ped sitting or interacting with a prop, and use the [Pleb Master's Database](https://forge.plebmasters.de/objects) to find the exact prop

------------------------------------------

**Q: Some prop interactions are broken, the ped stands inside the prop, floats above the prop, or when they get off the prop it's awkward. How can I fix this!??**

**A:** Blame Rockstar. There isn't exactly much we can do about this except find a different prop that works with this script, and hope for the best. 

You can however change the direction of which the ped faces when doing the interactive animation on the prop, using codewalker.

------------------------------------------

**Q: Can I change the interaction that a ped performs on a prop?**

**A:** Probably, however you would need to consult codewalker as I am not 100% sure.

You could however use [rpemotes](https://github.com/davismasondaniel/rpemotes) to perform other sitting animations etc.
